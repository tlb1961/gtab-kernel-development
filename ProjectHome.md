A community based effort to keep the G Tablet updated with Android beyond 2.2 by developing newer kernels supporting the G Tablet hardware allowing for full HW acceleration, etc.  We will now be working with the folks at tabletroms.com in a collaborative effort.  Thank you to everyone on both teams for all of your efforts thus far!  If you have been a contributor please let us know so we can keep an active list of creds, so everyone is recognized!
